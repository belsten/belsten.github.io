## Bio

I am interested in neuroscience, ML, statistical modeling, and signal processing. I recently received my B.S. in Computer and Systems Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In my free time I enjoy climbing, cycling or running. I also sometimes make small chairs. Big fan of oat milk.
