## Bio

I am an excited incoming Vision Science Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. I plan to work with  Dr. Bruno Olshausen at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu).

I am interested in neuroscience, machine learning, statistical modeling, and signal processing. In 2020, I received my B.S. in Computer and Systems Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. From 2018 to the present, I've had the fortunate opportunity to do research at the [National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies](https://www.neurotechcenter.org) in Albany NY and Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, where I develop BCI2000 and get to work with the latest bidirectional neural devices.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, cycling or running. I also sometimes make small chairs. Big fan of oat milk.
