## Bio

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu), advised by Dr. Bruno Olshausen. I am interested in computational neuroscience, theoretical neuroscience, vision, signal processing, machine learning.

In 2020, I received my B.S. in computer and systems engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. From 2018 to 2022, I had the fortunate opportunity to do research with Dr. Peter Brunner at the [National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies](https://www.neurotechcenter.org) in Albany, New York and Washington University in St. Louis, Dept. of Neurosurgery, where I developed BCI2000 and got to work with the latest intracranial recording and neural stimulation devices.

In my free time, I enjoy running, biking, and surfing -- also a big fan of oat milk and finding free stuff.
