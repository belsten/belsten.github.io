## Bio

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu), advised by Dr. Bruno Olshausen. I am interested in neuroscience (particularly early vision), machine learning, and signal processing.

In 2020, I received my B.S. in computer and systems engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. From 2018 to the present, I've had the fortunate opportunity to do research with Dr. Peter Brunner at the [National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies](https://www.neurotechcenter.org) in Albany, New York and Washington University in St. Louis, Dept. of Neurosurgery, where I developed BCI2000 and got to work with the latest intracranial recording and stimulation neural devices.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, cycling, and running (not at the same time). Big fan of oat milk and found free stuff.
