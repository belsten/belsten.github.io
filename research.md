## National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies
At [NCAN](https://www.neurotechcenter.org/) I worked on maintaining and improving
[BCI2000](https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), a [general purpose software for brain-computer interfacing](http://belsten.github.io/doc/BCI2000_A_General-Purpose_Brain-Computer.pdf). I added support for a variety of bio-signal acquisition devices.
These devices include:
* [Brain Products actiCHamp Plus](https://pressrelease.brainproducts.com/actichamp_plus/)
* Magstim-EGI NA 400 and GTEN 200, Enabling closed-loop transcranial stimulation via EEG
* Fully implantable telemetry-based CNS monitor and stimulator for small laboratory animals
* [g.tec Estim PRO Switching Unit](https://www.gtec.at/product/gestim-pro/) that enables automatic switching of channels for cortical stimulation

I also improved support for peripheral inputs to BCI2000 such as parallel port recording and webcam devices.
### Accepted Papers
**Hardware Abstraction to Facilitate the Dissemination and Validation of Electrophysiological Experiments**, Alexander Belsten, Markus Adamek, Peter Brunner. One-page research paper and presentation accepted at 42nd EMBC 2020 conference.

Discussed the necessity of an abstraction layer over heterogeneous bio-signal hardware and how that abstraction layer enables collaboration and the validation of electrophysiological experiments.

Designed a multi-branch one-dimensional convolutional neural network to predict the flight state of fly-by-feel aircraft using data recorded from the surface of an airfoil. Interested in **why** a specific architecture has better, or worse, results and what those results can tell us about the system's dynamics and information present at each sensor. Abstract detailing preliminary results submitted to 2021 AIAA AVIATION forum.
