### Invasive Cortical Stimulation

</p>
In the Department of Neurosurgery at WashU, I developed a system to explore cortical areas with electrical stimulation via ECoG and SEEG, which significantly improves the efficiency of collecting CCEP (cortico-cortical evoked potentials) data. This system also provides the technical basis to perform closed-loop cortical stimulation over hundreds of electrode sites. It is currently in use at Mayo Clinic and will be adopted by additional institutions, such as the Stanford School of Medicine.

This system is built on BCI2000, [g.tec cortical stimulator](https://www.gtec.at/product/gestim-pro/), and g.tec switching unit.

## National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies
At WashU and [NCAN](https://www.neurotechcenter.org/) I worked on maintaining and improving
[BCI2000](https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), a [general purpose software for brain-computer interfacing](http://belsten.github.io/doc/BCI2000_A_General-Purpose_Brain-Computer.pdf). I added support for a variety of bio-signal acquisition and peripheral devices.
These devices include:
* [CorTec BrainInterchange](https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/CortecADC)
* [Magstim-EGI NA 400 and GTEN 200](https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/Contributions:AmpServerProADC)
* [g.Estim Switching Unit](https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/Contributions:g.EstimSwitchingUnit)
* [g.Estim PRO cortial stimulator](https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/Contributions:gEstimFilter)

Designed a multi-branch one-dimensional convolutional neural network to predict the flight state of fly-by-feel aircraft using data recorded from the surface of an airfoil. Interested in **why** a specific architecture has better, or worse, results and what those results can tell us about the system's dynamics and information present at each sensor.
