## National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies
At [NCAN](https://www.neurotechcenter.org/) I worked on maintaining and improving
[BCI2000](https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), a [general purpose software for brain-computer interfacing](http://belsten.github.io/doc/BCI2000_A_General-Purpose_Brain-Computer.pdf). I added support for a variety of bio-signal acquisition devices.
These devices include:
* [Brain Products actiCHamp Plus](https://pressrelease.brainproducts.com/actichamp_plus/)
* Magstim-EGI NA 400 and GTEN 200, Enabling closed-loop transcranial stimulation via EEG
* Fully implantable telemetry-based CNS monitor and stimulator for small laboratory animals
* [g.tec Estim PRO Switching Unit](https://www.gtec.at/product/gestim-pro/) that enables automatic switching of channels for cortical stimulation

I also improved support for peripheral inputs to BCI2000 such as parallel port recording and webcam devices.
### Accepted Papers
**Hardware Abstraction to Facilitate the Dissemination and Validation of Electrophysiological Experiments**, Alexander Belsten, Markus Adamek, Peter Brunner. One-page research paper and presentation accepted at 42nd EMBS 2020 conference.

Discussed the necessity of an abstraction layer over heterogeneous bio-signal hardware and how that abstraction layer, and BCI2000, enables collaboration and the validation of science.

## Bio-Inspired Fly-by-Feel Aerospace Vehicles
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../assets/MCNN_arch.png" width="60%" align="middle"></p>


Applied machine learning techniques to time series data in order to predict flight state of fly-by-feel aircraft. A variety of non-parametric CNN architectures were implemented in order to learn how the flight state (such as angle of attack and airspeed) can be best identified. Also interested in **why** a specific architecture has better, or worse, results and what those results can tell us about the dynamics of the system.

## In the future...
In December 2020 I will be joining Dr. Peter Brunner's lab at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. While there, I will continue to maintain BCI2000 as well as expand my involvement in neuro-based research.
