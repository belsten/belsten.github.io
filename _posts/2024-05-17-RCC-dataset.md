[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Bhk8VeBadXM3lmq-KhDv0-7PkgyfKoJ/view?usp=share_link) is a link to download the twelve hyperspectral images  used in 'Statistics of cone responses to natural images: implications for visual coding' (1998) by Ruderman, Daniel L and Cronin, Thomas W and Chiao, Chuan-Chin. A basic conversion of the hyperspectral data to RGB can be seen above. 

I've included a short script on how to read the data in python. Feel free to reach out if there are any issues.
